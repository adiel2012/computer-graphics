    "### What is a Feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **feature** (or **keypoint**) is a distinctive, repeatable point in an image:\n",
    "- Can be reliably detected in different images\n",
    "- Invariant to transformations (rotation, scale, illumination)\n",
    "- Has a distinctive neighborhood (descriptor)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Feature Detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image matching**: Find corresponding points between images\n",
    "2. **Object recognition**: Identify objects by their features\n",
    "3. **3D reconstruction**: Recover 3D structure from 2D images\n",
    "4. **Tracking**: Follow objects across video frames\n",
    "5. **Image stitching**: Create panoramas\n",
    "6. **Camera calibration**: Determine camera parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Features Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Repeatability**: Detected consistently across views\n",
    "2. **Distinctiveness**: Unique characteristics\n",
    "3. **Locality**: Small, well-defined regions\n",
    "4. **Quantity**: Sufficient for robust matching\n",
    "5. **Accuracy**: Precise localization\n",
    "6. **Efficiency**: Fast computation"
